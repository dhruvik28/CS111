Assign1 - Dhruvik Patel, dp811

Program to calculate the resistance value (in ohms) of a three band resistor.

Inputs: integer corresponding to the colors, where 0 = black, 1 = brown, 2 = red, 3 = orange, 4 = yellow, and 5 = green, stored in the variables band1, band2, and band3

Outputs: resistance + "ohms"

Error conditions: If the user inputs an integer where it is less than zero and more than 5, programs halts and outputs "Error". If the user inputs 0 for band 1 and band 2, programs halts and outputs "Error. Cannot hava 0 ohms".

Pseduocode:

let the user type a integer corresponding to the color of band 1 and store it into the variable band1;

if (band1 != 0 && band1 != 1 && band1 != 2 && band1 != 3 && band1 != 4 && band1 != 5)
	output "Error. Not a valid integer";
	halt;

let the user type a integer corresponding to the color of band 2 and store it into the variable band2;

if (band2 != 0 && band2 != 1 && band2 != 2 && band2 != 3 && band2 != 4 && band2 != 5)
	output "Error. Not a valid integer"
	halt;

if (band1 == 0 && band2 == 0)
    output "Error. Cannot have 0 ohms"
    halt;

let the user type a integer corresponding to the color of band 3 and store it into the variable band3;

if (band3 != 0 && band3 != 1 && band3 != 2 && band3 != 3 && band3 != 4 && band3 != 5)
	output "Error. Not a valid integer"
	halt;

declare a new variable called digit1;
assign digit1 = band1 times(*) 10;

declare a new variable called value;
assign value = digit1 plus (+) band2;

declare a new variable called multipler and initiate it;
if (band3 == 0)
	multipler = 1;
if (band3 == 1)
	multipler = 10;
if (band3 == 2)
	multipler = 100;
if (band3 == 3)
	multipler = 1000;
if (band3 == 4)
	multipler = 10000;
if (band3 == 5)
	multipler = 100000;

declare a new variable called resistance;
assign resistance = value times(*) multipler;

output resistance + "ohms"
